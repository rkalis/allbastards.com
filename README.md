# AllBastards.com

AllBastards.com is a website for browsing the entire Bastard GAN Punk collection. It uses infinite scrolling and lazy loading as well as the WebP image/animation format for performance enhancement. All settings are persisted in local storage. The website is built using React and TailwindCSS. The funky background was made by Berk (the creator of BASTARD GAN PUNKS)!
